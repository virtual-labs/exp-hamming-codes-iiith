### Procedure

There are two tasks in this experiment.
<br>
<br>

**Procedure for Encoding:**
*   The objective of this task is to learn about the encoding of a (7, 4) Hamming code.
*   Enter all the three parity bits in the fields provided and click on **Submit**.
*   The correctness of the answer is displayed in **Observations**.
*   **Reset -** Clears all the entered parity bits.
*   **Next** - Displays the next example. Solve sufficient number of examples.

**Procedure for Error-Correction:**
*   The objective of this task is to correct a single error in a (7, 4) Hamming code.
*   Clicking on a bit toggles the value in it.
*   The figure shows a vector obtained by flipping any single bit of a codeword.
*   Identify the error location by following the procedure given in theory. Then, flip the bit corresponding to the error location and click on **Submit**.
*   **Observations** displays whether you have corrected the error or not.
*   **Reset -** Resets back all the bits to the original codeword.
*   ***Next** - Displays the next example. Solve sufficient number of examples.
