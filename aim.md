# Aim

In this experiment, the student will learn about the basic properties of Hamming codes. A binary Hamming code of parameters [7,4,3] can be represented through a diagram of 3 circles. We will illustrate the encoding of Hamming codes through three circles. We will demonstrate the minimum distance of the code. We will also show how a received vector with a single error can be corrected by the Hamming code.

The structure of the experiment is as follows:

- Encoding
- Error Correction
